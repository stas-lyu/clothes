      "description":[ " The origin of the Japanese company Casio goes back to the deep forties of the last century .. Its founder was a humble boy Tadao Kasio. Since childhood, Tadao has shown incredible abilities and an extraordinary thirst for knowledge. The young man's talents were noticed by the managers of the plant where he worked in order to financially help the family. The company paid for the guy's higher education, which later allowed him to open his own business with his brothers. "]
